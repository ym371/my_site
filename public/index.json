I am a PhD student at the Deparment of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Soledad Villar. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and deep learning. I am exploring how to incorporate mathematical ideas into the design of new deep learning algorithms, while also investigating how deep learning can aid in solving challenging mathematical problems. Currently, my focus is on Graph Neural Networks and Equivariant Neural Networks.\nPreviously, I completed an MMath and BA Hons degree in Mathematics at University of Cambridge. During my master\u0026rsquo;s studies, I focused on Statistics and completed an essay on Topological Data Analysis.\nWhile this website is currently very empty, I am planning to gradually build it up during my PhD years.

My journey took me to Singapore and Cambridge (UK), where I had the privilege of living and studying before embarking on my PhD in Baltimore (US).\nDuring my time at Cambridge, I spent four years studying the Mathematical Tripos, which exposed me to a diverse range of mathematical areas. This experience fueled my passion for two distinct directions: the rigorous study of abstract structures (with abstract algebra, geometry, topology, and category theory as my favorites) and the practical modeling of real-world data (involving statistics and machine learning). The convergence of these interests prompted me to explore interdisciplinary realms, as I began to believe that the deepest human wisdom is embedded in the underlying connections and shared insights across different topics.\nIn my fourth year at Cambridge, I was introduced to the field of Geometric Deep Learning through Prof. Michael Bronstein\u0026rsquo;s illuminating talk. This area, precisely at the intersection of my interests, captivated me with its expansive mathematical theories and exciting applications propelling advancements in artificial intelligence. Intrigued by the possibilities it presented, I decided to pursue a PhD to delve deeper into this area. I was very fortunate to have joined Soledad\u0026rsquo;s group at JHU, and I am now relishing every moment of my time here!\nResesarch interests #Here, I outline some of the topics I am currently exploring and feel passionately about.
