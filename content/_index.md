Hi! I am a first year PhD student at the [Deparment of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Soledad Villar](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/villar/). My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and deep learning. I am exploring how to incorporate mathematical ideas into the design of new deep learning algorithms, while also investigating how deep learning can aid in solving challenging mathematical problems. Currently, my focus is on **Graph Neural Networks** and **Equivariant Neural Networks**.

Previously, I completed an [MMath and BA Hons degree in Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad) at University of Cambridge. During my master's studies, I focused on Statistics and completed an [essay](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AvmtE7tyQT_ggrMNzUn0DccMM91-qQ?e=NHORc7) on **Topological Data Analysis**.

To learn more about my background and research interests, you can check out my [CV](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AvmtE7tyQT_ggrFpSQNhB2DoLdyEmQ?e=pKYH4r) and the [About me](https://yuxinma98.github.io/about/) section.

While this website is currently very empty, I am planning to gradually build it up during my PhD years. Stay tuned!
