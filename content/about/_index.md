## My background

I was born and raised in Nanjing, a city in China that blends ancient charm with modern vibrancy. My journey took me to Singapore and Cambridge (UK), where I had the privilege of living and studying before embarking on my PhD in Baltimore (US).

During my time at Cambridge, I spent four years studying the [Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad), which exposed me to a diverse range of mathematical areas. This experience fueled my passion for two distinct directions: the rigorous study of **abstract structures** (with abstract algebra, geometry, topology, and category theory as my favorites) and the practical modeling of **real-world data** (involving statistics and machine learning). The convergence of these interests prompted me to explore interdisciplinary realms, as I began to believe that the deepest human wisdom is embedded in the underlying connections and shared insights across different topics. 

In my fourth year at Cambridge, I was introduced to the field of **Geometric Deep Learning** through [Prof. Michael Bronstein's illuminating talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Pw4MOzMuo). This area, precisely at the intersection of my interests, captivated me with its expansive mathematical theories and exciting applications propelling advancements in artificial intelligence. Intrigued by the possibilities it presented, I decided to pursue a PhD to delve deeper into this area. I was very fortunate to have joined Soledad's group at JHU, and I am now relishing every moment of my time here!
